## Description

It is a web-page about "Rick and Motry" cartoon.
There are 4 pages:

  Here you can find all characters which have been in this cartoon and their full information about themselves;
2. Episodes page.
  Here is all information about each episode showing in table;
3. Location page.
  All information about each location (also showing in table);
4. Watch list.
  Here you can add a name of episode you want to watch later.
  Each adding saves to your local storage, so if you refresh a web-page - the watch list will be the same.
  Also, if you watched an episode you wanted, you can mark it as finished. And it will be saved to locale storage too.
